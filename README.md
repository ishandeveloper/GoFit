### How it works?

GoFit is a game where you strap your phone on your arm. Stand in front of your laptop with the GoFit website open. A game starts playing on the laptop where your character is running and obstacles are coming from the front(similar to Subway Surfers). You have to actually jump, turn left and right to control your character.

#### The phone straped to your arm records your movements and send it to the game in real-time.
